- BE. FUCKING. CONFIDENT. 
- You're one of the best improvisers in the world, you're just a bit rusty. 
- make bold, distinct offers. Accents work well, as do physicalities.
- Just breath.
- It's cool if you walk on stage with no fucking idea of what to do.
- Don't do transaction scenes. They're boring.
- Don't make the scene about off-stage people.
- Slooooooooooooooooooow down. There's no rush. 
- Staging is important. Make sure that you're downstage center.
