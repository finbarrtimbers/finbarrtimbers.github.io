Title: Innovation & healthcare
Date: 2013-02-26 12:28

A pretty cool new [API](https://eligibleapi.com) was recently released. Eligible aims to make electronic patient records much easier to access; currently, the industry uses a hodge-podge of standards; Eligible parses them, and makes the data easy to use. 

I hope that Eligible succeeds. I am not hopeful.

Innovation in healthcare is *hard*- there is always a very high potential of losing a huge lawsuit and being wiped out. In the Sunday Edition of the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com "The New York Times") (which can be delivered to Edmontonians!), an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/business/overcoming-obstacles-to-better-health-care.html?_r=0 "Overcoming obstacles to better health care") laid out some of the main issues preventing said innovation from occuring. 

The problem is simple: the legal framework surrounding malpractice is completely screwed up. In the article, it is stated that

"As it is now, a doctor or hospital can be sued if the plaintiff can show that “normal standards of care” were not followed, even if those normal standards of care are inappropriate."

Assuming that this is correct (I am neither a physician nor a lawyer), this basically freezes innovation, and makes it nigh impossible for innovation to occur. 

Compare this to, say, the regulatory framework for file-sharing [systems](http://www.dropbox.com "Dropbox") or [automobiles](http://www.teslamotors.com "Tesla"). Both have much lower regulatory hurdles, and have seen massive innovation. Although healthcare is incomparable to either, I believe that it is worth considering loosening the rules surrounding healthcare, and implementing some of the suggestions made in the article, particularly the 'safe harbour' provision.
