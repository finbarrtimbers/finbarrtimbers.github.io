title: Bold policy moves in Alberta 1: After Oil

Alberta can afford to make political moves that no other province can because Alberta has oil, and consequently, money. This will not last. The most important move Albertan politicians can do is position the province for when the oil runs out. In a series of articles, I will explore the policy options that Albertan politicians need to be pursuing to best position the province for an economy that doesn't rely on oil. First: revenue.

# Revenue

The Albertan economy lives and dies on the price of oil. That's problematic. Oil revenues are highly volatile, and don't conform to predictions, as Robin Campbell is currently finding out. Problematic though this is, it's a problem that's familiar to one despicable breed of person- economists. A central plank of public economics is the notion of cyclical trends. Alberta needs to enact acyclical measures to flatten out the boom/bust cycle, or what economists call
"consumption smoothing." The best way to do this is to create alternate sources of revenue that aren't tied to the price of oil.

The best way to do so? Increase spending on post-secondary education. However, the government shouldn't do so blindly. Alberta does not need more humanities grads, or even more economics grads (as handsome, intelligent, and well spoken as we are). Alberta needs more people educated in the trades, in the hard sciences, and in business. Redford had the right idea in 2013 when she [announced](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/university-of-calgary-engineering-receives-1425-million-from-province/article14768330/) that the government was funding an expansion of the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering at the cost of the rest of Albertan PSE. Much as the PSE lobbyists squawked, it was the right move, and one that current political parties should endorse.

Danielle Smith called for "100 bloggers" to write about Wildrose policy. Well, as an erstwhile blogger: the Wildrose Party should enshrine in the party platform the importance of funding post secondary education at an extremely high level and commit to keeping the funding stable. The funding should be tied to specific programs and faculties, and designed to make theAlberta the world's leading engineering capital. Funding should go to the faculties of engineering, science, and business, creating named professorships and dedicated student research funding.

Moreover, the government should create incentives for the highly educated Albertan students to remain in the province by creating a tax credit to pay off student loans for every year that the newly graduated engineer/scientist works in Alberta. The government should also provide tax incentives for companies to conduct R&D in Alberta.

If the government followed such a program, then in 20 years, Alberta's economy would be thriving on the backs of brilliant engineers and scientists. With Alberta as the beating heart of Canadian industrial innovation, the province would see massive spillover effects creating a reverse brain-drain into Alberta.
