Title: Opportunity in the US
Date: 2013-02-20 12:28

Even though I'm still frantically preparing for [HSMUN](hsmun.org) (oh god! It's tomorrow!), I still find the time to procrastinate. The Atlantic had an [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/why-clarence-thomas-uses-simple-words-in-his-opinions/273326/) about Clarence Thomas's philosophy on writing (it also had a sad coda about his law school debt- he didn't finish paying it off until his third term on the court). 

I found it notable because I've never been a fan of Thomas. His (alleged) conduct with respect to Anita Hill in his EEOC days have made it impossible for me to like him. However, seeing how he works to make the law accessible to the poor caused me to gain some respect for him, as all too often, it seems like the law can act against the poor. 

The article was also notable as it reminded me of his [upbringing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_thomas); his story reminds me of [Michelle Obama's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama#Family_and_education), in that both are descendants of slaves, and rose to the American elite through education. It's a stark reminder of the opportunities offered by education, but more so, it's a reminder of how important [equality of opportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity) is, something that is often overlooked. 

This is particularly relevant given [the](http://www.thewandereronline.com/2013/02/18/why-the-su-elections-require-serious-reflection-by-emerson-csorba/) [recent](http://www.thewandereronline.com/2013/02/20/not-enough-female-leaders-take-a-page-from-nursings-book-i-by-maggie-danko/) [kerfluffle](http://www.thewandereronline.com/2013/02/20/confidence-is-key-to-becoming-a-woman-on-top-by-sydney-rudko/) [over](http://www.thewandereronline.com/2013/02/19/barriers-to-running-its-not-a-womens-issue-by-navneet-khinda/) the presence (or lack thereof) of women in the Student's Union Executive; does the lack of equality of outcome indicate a lack of equality of opportunity? And if so, does this necessitate legislative action?
