There have been a number of recent news articles saying that the IMF is forecasting Kenya to begin oil production in 6-7 years (including the venerable  "GhettoRadio.co.ke"):

However, I pulled up the actual IMF report:

http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13107.pdf

The only thing that it says about Kenya oil production (or, really, the only thing I could find) is the line

"Kenya expects to start producing oil in 6-7 years"

This is meaningless. Moreover, it is certainly not an endorsement by the IMF of the potential for Kenya to begin oil production in 6 years. 
It is merely a statement saying Kenya hopes to.

In other words, read primary sources kids.
