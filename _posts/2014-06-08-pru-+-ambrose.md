The play was in the minimalistic vein popular in contemporary [film][1]. The plot was not present, as the play was less a narrative piece than a thematice one; the purpose was art, rather than to tell a story/convey a message.

The actors' performance was not raw, showing a clear sense of self, and not fully surrendering to the role. The piece depicted a mentally ill#{Mentally ill is not the appropriate sentiment; Prue was mentally ill insofar as Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's was.} character who was gradually transforming her house into a heap.

Certain arts needs specific media. Prue & Ambrose would have been better as a film. 

# Future direction

I want to try to perform a 'typewriter'-esque play. 
I want to create a minimalist set through outline; see photo.
Use improv rules in writing; blocking & questions make for weak scripts.
Gormless characters are boring characters. Everyone matters to himself; make that evident.
Ben Gorodetsky does confidence well; emulate him. 

[1]: [Tree of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)), by Terence Malick, is exemplary of the genre.
