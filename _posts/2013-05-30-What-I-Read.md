As a means of self-reflection upon all the procrastination I do, here is a list of the sites I frequent. I plan on keeping this as a work in progress and continually adding to it. 

#Blogs

* Chris Blattman's [blog](http://chrisblattman.com)

Blattman is a professor of political science at SIPA, and has a Ph. D. in Econ. He's also Canadian. I read him as he has advice that is extremely pertinent to me, as he has taken a career path almost identical to the one that I plan to pursue. 

* [Michael O. Church](http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/)

Michael O. Church is a former googler (Xoogler?) who became infamous for his dislike of their personell review system. He writes mostly about tech and entrepreneurship, but also focuses on social mobility and general economic opportunity. 

* [Greg Mankiw](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.ca/)

I have a man crush on Mankiw. Like Blattman, Mankiw has had a career that I hope to emulate, and he posts high-quality material on economics that is not too technical. Like a conservative Krugman. 

#News

* The [New York Times](nyt.com)

The Grey Lady is (arguably) the highest quality newspaper in the world. I have never been led astray by their reporting, and I find their coverage to be extremely good. It's a solid all-purpose news source.

* The [Financial Times](ft.com)

Similar to the NYT, the FT is great for its coverage of Financial and Economics news. The U of A has a corporate subscription, so I'm able to get summaries of their coverage sent to me each morning; it makes for a good daily briefing (and makes me feel important). 

* The [Globe and Mail](globeandmail.com)

Great source of Canadian news. I read the print edition every morning.

#Social Media

* [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com)

Hacker News is THE place to go if you're interested in software or entrepreneurship. I cannot speak highly enough of it. If you have any interest in start-up culture, or in Silicon Valley, go there right now.

* Twitter

Twitter is excellent in that, although it has a high Noise-to-signal ratio, if you choose the appropriate people to follow, you can greatly increase this. If something happens, you'll here about it first on twitter, and be able to receive real time reactions from very intelligent people very quickly.
