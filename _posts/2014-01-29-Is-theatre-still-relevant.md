RADA posted an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/lolita-chakrabarti-red-velvet-and-whats-wrong-with-theatre-today-9088989.html) by a writer of a West End play talking about the (in-)accessibility of modern theatre.

I agree with her. Modern theatre is too expensive, by far, when compared to film, and the unique limitations of theatre (which are why theatre is brilliant), make it difficult for the stage to compete with film as a modern form of artistic media. What does it cost to publish a play online? Nothing? Pennies if you're doing your own hosting? By comparison, even the smallest play would require several thousand dollars to stage, as one needs to find a space and pay people to staff it. As a result, film will always dominate theatre.
