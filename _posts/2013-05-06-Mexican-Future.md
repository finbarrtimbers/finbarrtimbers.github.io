This [white paper]( http://j.mp/11bCt3g) offers a glimpse at one potential future for war torn Mexico:


"A decade ago Colombia was in a terrible mess. The country had the highest homicide rate in the world, and was the center of the international drug industry. Kidnapping was rife. A series of leading politicians had been assassinated, 
and probably one-third of all the legislators elected in 2002 received “assistance” from paramilitary groups. "

"....Foreign direct investment over the past 10 years has risen from $1.5 billion to $13 billion. Investment has grown from 17 percent of GDP to 27 percent of GDP... Saving, meanwhile, has increased to around 18 percent of GDP. Government debt has fallen from nearly 60 percent of GDP in 2002 to 43 percent today. And the rate of economic growth has accelerated: After averaging 3 percent per year between 1990 and 1999, it rose to 4.2 percent on average between 2000 and 2011. Finally in 2011, US President Barack Obama signed a free trade agreement with Colombia."
