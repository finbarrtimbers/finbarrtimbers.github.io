<p>Iâ€™m working through <a href="[1]">TSA</a>, and I noticed that some of my classmates are struggling to understand the difference between an ARIMA process, an AR process, and a MA process, not to mention seasonal version of the above.</p>

<p>Using $$B$$ as the lag operator, i.e. $$BX_t = X_{t-1}$$, an <em>ARIMA(p, d, q) process</em> is a discrete time stochastic process of the form</p>

<p>$$ \phi(B) (1 - B)^d X_t = \theta(B)w_t, $$</p>

<p>where $$\phi$$ is a polynomial of degree <em>p</em>, and $$\theta$$ is a polynomial of degree <em>q</em>. An <em>AR(p)</em> process is an ARIMA(<em>p, 0, 0</em>) process, and a MA(<em>q</em>) process is an ARIMA(<em>0, 0, q</em>) process. To make life even more complicated, we introduce the notion of seasonality:</p>

<p>An ARIMA$$(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q)_s$$ model is a s.p. of the form</p>

<p>$$ \Phi(B^s) \phi(B) (1 - B^s)^D (1 - B)^d X_t = \Theta(B^s)\theta(B)w_t, $$</p>

<p>where $$\Phi(B)$$ is a polynomial of degree $$P$$, and $$\Theta(B)$$ is a polynomial of degree $$Q$$.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<p>Suppose we have the stochastic process</p>

<p>$$ X_t = \frac 1 2 X_{t-1} + X_{t-4} - \frac 1 2 X_{t-5} + w_t - \frac 1 4 w_{t-4}. $$</p>

<p>How can we write this as an ARIMA$$(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q)_s$$ model? Note that</p>

<p>$$ (1 - B^4) X_t = \frac 1 2 X_{t-1} - \frac 1 2 X_{t-5} + w_t - \frac 1 4 w_{t-4}. $$</p>

<p>We can rewrite this as</p>

<p>$$ (1 - B^4) X_t - \frac{1}{2} B (1 - B^4)X_t = (1 - \frac 1 4 B^4) w_t, $$</p>

<p>or, more concisely,</p>

<p>$$ (1 - B^4) (1 - \frac 1 2 B) X_t = (1 - \frac 1 4 B^4) w_t. $$</p>

<p>Consequently, we can see that $$X_t$$ is an ARIMA$$(1, 0, 0) \times (0, 1, 1)_4$$ process.</p>
