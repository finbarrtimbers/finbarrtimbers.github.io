<p>How does a regulator set taxes? Typically, the regulator sets a rate at the point where MD = MAC. If the company over-reports MAC, then the regulator ends up taxing the firm more than it would have otherwise.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When does MD, MAC knowledge come into play?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If MD is unknown, but MAC is known, then losses are the same for both taxes and permits, as the response of polluters to the policies is determined by the MAC curve, which is known with certainty.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If MD is known, but MAC is unknown, a tax will overshoot the optimum, implementing too much abatement. A quantity instrument, such as a permits auction, will cause too little abatement. The relative utility of the policies thus depends on the slopes of the MAC/MD curves, and the relative merit is debatable.</p>

<p>How were permits allocated? What were the (dis)advantages of this system?</p>

<p>Owners of electric generating units are given fixed numbers of allowances based on historic emissions and fuel use. Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>easy way to allocate allowances</li>

<li>provides a clear and understandable means of doing so</li>

<li>incorporating fuel use creates an incentive to use more efficient fuels, especailly ones that might not be economically affordable witout the incentive</li>

<li>Free → easy political buy in.</li>

<li>the market based nature of the system allowed the system to take into account the massive number of old, inefficient, plants.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantage(s):</p>

<ul>
<li>if historic emissions are taken into account, there is a clear incentive to drive up emissions in the years before the program begun.</li>

<li>leads to adverse selection problems -&gt; firms that reduce most are subsequently penalised, firms that reduce least get more allowances</li>

<li>If allowances are free, it misses an opportunity to riase funds, and can make it still profitable to overemit.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Were permit holders allowed to bank permits? Yes! Banking was one of the fundamental features of the system.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>How did banking contribute to the success of the system?</p>

<ul>
<li>Prices of allowances were expected to rise from Phase I to Phase II, so many firms banked allowances for price reasons</li>

<li>Efficient allowances market emerged, obeying the law of one price -&gt; success, as the marginal cost of emitting becomes unifomr across the country</li>

<li>10% of emissions were covered by allowances from other units</li>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>1/3rd of emissions from Phase 1 were banked</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>volumes were significantly higher than in the EPA auctions for more allowances</li>

<li>efficient market developed as the top and bottoms of the market converged</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>How did permit holders behave w.r.t. banking?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Did the low price of permits reflect a failure of the system? If so, what was the failing, and how was it linked to the low price? Market participants faced an initial decision between building carbon scrubbers and purchasing allowances. Given that the decision had to be made well before the start of trading, firms were obligated to make the decision based on the predictions of analysts; as analysts predicted very high prices for carbon, firms made the decision to install scrubbers, which dramatically lowered the cost of carbon, as far fewer firms needed to purchase it. Consequently, the carbon market price was much lower than expected.</p>

<p>Technological standards are very effective at reducing emissions, but are inflexible, due to the large amounts of time and money involved. Consequently, emissions trading is preferred to technological standards, as it allows.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What lessons can Canada draw from the SO₂ emissions trading system to develop a Cap and Trade system for reducing GHGs?</p>

<ul>
<li>The tradable permit approach is strictly superior to command-and-control approaches. Title IV more than achieved the SO₂ emissions goal, on time, without extensive legislation, and at lower costs than predicted.</li>

<li>large-scale tradable permit programs can work -&gt; they can guarantee emissions reductions, and allow emitters to reduce compliance costs</li>

<li>a tradable permit program can prouce surprises, and can react well to surprises produced elsewhere -&gt; agile!</li>

<li>efficient, competitive markets can take time to develop -&gt; program design can speed p price discovers and market development</li>

<li>tradable permits are not perfect -&gt; one could not use a tradable permit approach to deal with, say, an isolated rousce with only local effects, as no market would exist</li>
