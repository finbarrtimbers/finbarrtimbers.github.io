### [Abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585)

Synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images has been a long-standing
challenge in machine learning. In this paper we introduce new methods for the
improved training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image
synthesis. We construct a variant of GANs employing label conditioning that
results in 128x128 resolution image samples exhibiting global coherence. We
expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses
for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from
class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high
resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution
samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, 128x128 samples are more than twice as
discriminable as artificially resized 32x32 samples. In addition, 84.7% of the
classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data.
