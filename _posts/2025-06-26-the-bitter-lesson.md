[The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) is an excellent essay which is overwhelmingly misunderstood. The point of the bitter lesson is that, over time, methods which scale with compute will outperform methods that do not.

It is not:

  * The idea that we should never incorporate human knowledge

  * The idea that deep learning and scale are all we need (Rich is actually relatively skeptical of deep learning)




The entire point of the essay is that, in the last 5 decades, we have seen massive increases in the amount of compute available to us as an industry and we expect to continue to see [massive increases](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) in the amount of compute available to AI research. Methods which take advantage of compute will benefit, and those that do not will suffer.

The reason the lesson is bitter is that it is often much easier and quicker to get results by incorporating human knowledge.

If you’re training an autocomplete system in 1995, you’re probably not going to get very far with next token prediction, and instead, handcoded, or statistically generated rules will do better. In 2005, N-gram models are optimal. It isn’t until the mid 2010s that we start to see deep learning dominate in NLP, and not until the late 2010s that self supervised learning becomes dominant. At each point along the way, incorporating human knowledge has been advantageous, and has been a way that you can get an advantage over your competition. But in the long term, it’s a dead end. Methods which take advantage of more compute outperform over a sufficiently long time frame. Compute is the only parameter which we can expect to increase by several orders of magnitude. Much as I wish it were otherwise, it’s unlikely that we’ll see 1000x the number of tokens we have now. But in compute, that’s almost certain. 

The canonical example is computer chess. Before [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_\(chess_computer\)) expert systems were largely used. Deep Blue showed that leveraging compute to perform extensive searches against a hand coded value function[1](https://www.artfintel.com/p/the-bitter-lesson#footnote-1-166870478) performed extremely well. Deep Blue was a massive win for the “scale compute”/computer search crowd, as it was much more based on scale than human heuristics, but it required an evaluation function with 8000 custom chess features created by human experts, and the evaluation function weighted them using hand selected weights. One measure of the generality of the system is how easy it would be to extend it to a different scenario. To extend Deep Blue to work in Go would be extremely challenging, as one would need to come up with a proper evaluation function by creating another 8000 custom Go features.

Computer Go is another example where human knowledge fell short. [AlphaGo Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815) evaluated against the then state of the art Go bots, which included [Pachi](https://pasky.or.cz/go/pachi-tr.pdf), [GnuGo](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/gnugo_to_agz/), and [CrazyStone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Stone_\(software\)). Pachi and CrazyStone did MCTS with heuristic value functions, and GnuGo was an expert system, with a hand created decision tree to select moves. They were good at the time! But they were all ultimately dead ends. As Rich states in the article:

If you look at [GnuGo’s code](https://github.com/lungzeeyim/GNUgo), it was a lot of hard work by a lot of people, and was dramatically worse than what was possible. What’s surprising is that, while GnuGo [began in 1989](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/devel.html), released continued until 2009, so the authors were undoubtedly aware of Deep Blue and the stunning victory that scaled search had, yet they continued to push forward with their expert system. Brian Lee, a former Google Brain researcher who [replicated AlphaGo within Brain](https://github.com/tensorflow/MiniGo), offers a [compelling explanation](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/gnugo_to_agz/) for why:

> I offer another point: that these stages [of the Bitter Lesson] happen over the span of a decade or so. Over this decade, PhDs are minted, career identities built, promotion criteria set, culture defined, and org charts annealed. Much in the way that science progresses one funeral at a time, progress on difficult problems progresses one organization shutdown at a time.

Consider another scenario. You work at a LLM lab, and have to make your benchmark numbers bigger than your competition or you get fired. You have the immediate temptation to include human knowledge, which in this case might be specialized datasets for a specific benchmark. 

A better approach would be to make the model _generally_ stronger. Focusing on methods that scale with compute as a filter is a strong bet to make, as Jensen Huang is doing his best to give you multiple orders of magnitude more FLOPS. Methods like test time compute, synthetic data, or MoE models are great examples. But the problem with this approach, which when I write it down seems obvious, is that in the moment, it feels _indulgent_. We _don’t have time_ for proper science, we have to beat the other labs on LiveCodeBench. That is the bitter lesson: DeepSeek focuses on general improvements, gets them working, scales them to 3.8e25 FLOPS, and is SOTA. 

## Articles I’m reading right now:

  * [What comes next, by Nathan Lambert (Interconnects)](https://substack.com/home/post/p-166556899), discussing, among other aspects, how excellent O3 is.

  * [Undertrained tokens in R1](https://substack.com/home/post/p-158907079?source=queue), by [Sander Land](https://open.substack.com/users/217957273-sander-land?utm_source=mentions).
  
  * The [Deep Blue paper](https://x.com/finbarrtimbers/status/1938115342427165035), which is worth reading. 




[1](https://www.artfintel.com/p/the-bitter-lesson#footnote-anchor-1-166870478) Deep Blue is fascinating for a variety of reasons, including the fact that they had custom “chess chips” made to encode the evaluation function in hardware.
