# Music Lesson
- So, I've been wanting to take singing lessons for a while.
- Emailed the teacher, she gave me her address, told me to just walk in (she has other lessons, doesn't want to interrupt them).
- So I walk in, sit down. 
- I wait. Lesson doesn't start for 10 minutes.
- It's been 5 minutes, still nothing.
- Lesson's supposed to start, nothing. 
- 4:05, still nothing.
- 4:10, I start to freak out.
- I got the address wrong- I'm in some stranger's house. 
- I hear someone moving around upstairs.
- I book it out.
