I realized over the weekend that, unfortunately, I didn't know how back-propagation *actually* works (I just relied on JAX to do it for me).

So I wrote a pure Numpy neural network- with back-prop. Take a [look](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KDSJKhZDd5fdbnLTalPKcjS_IDu0Q968#scrollTo=XmS23jQ5U7Nw).
