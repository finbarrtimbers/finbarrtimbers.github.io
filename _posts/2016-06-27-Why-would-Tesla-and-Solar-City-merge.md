title: What benefit is there for Tesla Motors and SolarCity to merge?

There are two main benefits:

1) Tesla & SolarCity have a weird financial structure that's putting Elon Musk
under personal financial pressure. My understanding is that Tesla has a lot of
money, while SolarCity does not, so this helps Musk personally.

2) Synergy. One of the major requirements for mass adoption of solar technology
at home is that batteries be good, and cheap. Tesla has great battery tech, so
this lets the firms work together. There are also similar advantages in admin
staff, particularly for financial reporting, etc.

If you would like more detailed analysis of either company, please get in touch
