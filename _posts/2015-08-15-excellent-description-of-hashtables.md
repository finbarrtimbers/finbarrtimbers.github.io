I'm working through the [Algorithm Design Manual](
http://www.amazon.ca/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) to
improve the efficiency of my coding.

I came across an excellent description of how hashtables work:

I can't think of a better way to describe them. What an excellent metaphor.
