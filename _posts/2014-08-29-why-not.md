My friend [Angus](https://twitter.com/AngusAtEMC) and I have been tossing around the idea of a startup that automates personal investments (inspired by Jane, the AI from Ender's Game- I'll be talking more about it in a later post). I think we have a great idea. However, the idea seems *so obvious* that I just don't get why no one else is doing it.

Look at [Apptimize](http://apptimize.com/company/team/). Their team is absolutely nuts. Almost everyone went to MIT or Stanford, they have a ton of ex-Google alums, and they've got people who competed at the IMO level. Yet their company is working to make A/B testing easier. At best, that's a multi-million dollar market. If Apptimize became the absolute best company at A/B testing in the world, they could have a worth of *maybe* $500 million. At best. And that's stretching it.

With Jane, the potential market is huge- if we succeed, we could capture a large percentage of every person in the world's savings- a trillion dollar market. I don't understand why there's so little attention being dedicated to such an {interesting, lucrative, challenging} problem.
