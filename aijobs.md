This is biased towards my experience applying for staff research engineer positions coming out of DeepMind, so your experience might vary. 

*If youâ€™re a company looking to hire AI researchers/engineers, and want to be added to this list, please [email me](mailto:finbarrtimbers@gmail.com). I require a salary range for the post and a description of your remote policies.*

*I have a [Substack](https://finbarrtimbers.substack.com/) where I discuss AI research; if you want me to mention your job posting there, let me know. A fee will apply.*
