		<p>I'm a student at the University of Alberta, in the B. Sc. in Combined Honors Mathematics and Economics. I plan on going to graduate school in econ, as I believe that economics is one of the best avenues to have an immediate impact upon the world, especially at a young age.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
				
<p>I have three projects on the go right now:</p> 

		<p>Currently, I'm working on a <a href="www.uri.ualberta.ca">URI</a> grant  to study the theoretical infrastructure for judicial decisions in antitrust law. I'm working under the supervision of <a href="www.ualberta.ca/~landeo">Dr. Claudia Landeo</a> on this. </p>
		
		<p>At the same time, I've also received a <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp">NSERC USRA</a> to work on research in mathematical economics. We're studying the Prisoner's Dilemma in continuous time with noisy signals. This project is being complete under the supervision of <a href="www.ualberta.ca/~cfrei"> Dr. Chris Frei.</a></p>

		<p> Lastly, I'm working on a project that studies how countries can work to develop robust tax bases. I'm working on this one by myself. It's still in the very early stages of its life, but I have high hopes for it. </p>
