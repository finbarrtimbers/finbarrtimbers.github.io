		<h1>Finbarr Timbers</h1>
		
		<p>You can find me <a href="http://twitter.com/_finbarr">on Twitter</a> or send an email to <finbarr@finbarr.ca>.</p>
		
		<p>I'm a student at the University of Alberta. I study math and economics. I plan on going to graduate school in econ, as I think economics has the potential to radically help the developing world.</p>
				
		<p>Currently, I'm working on a <a href="www.uri.ualberta.ca">URI</a> grant  to study the theoretical infrastructure (or lack thereof) for judicial decisions in antitrust law. At the same time, I've also received a <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp">NSERC USRA</a> to work on research in mathematical economics. We're studying the Prisoner's Dilemma in continuous time with noisy signals.</p>
		
		<p>I expect to graduate in May 2014 with a first class honors degree in Mathematics and Economics from the  <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>.</p>
		
		 <p>I'm always up for meeting new people or getting together to chat/argue about politics, tech, or whatever's on the news. This is especially true if coffee's involved....</p>
