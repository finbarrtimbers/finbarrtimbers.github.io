I've been cast in a student-directed production of James Tallman's "Trans-Canada Highway." It's for Camille Maltais' final project for Drama 383, the intro to directing class here at Alberta. I've been cast as "Slim," a young man who is an experienced hitchhiker at 21. 

I met up with Camille and Karen, who's playing Jane, the other role in the play, and we read through the play. Immediate thoughts: 

* I don't innately like the play. That's not to say I won't enjoy it, but it's not something I would have picked. 

* Slim is a very strong character. With enough scriptwork, he'll easily fall into place. 

* Lots of lines. It'll be tight trying to learn them all in time. 

I'm excited. It's been too long since I've acted seriously, and I'm looking forward to getting back in it.
