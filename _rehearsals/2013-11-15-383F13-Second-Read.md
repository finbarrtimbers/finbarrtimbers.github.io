I spent a few hours doing scriptwork on my own on Sunday. It felt good-- the play's detailed, so I'll be spending a few more hours working through it. I'm beginning to fall in love with Slim. He's a layered character, and I can have some fun with him. It's nice someone likeable. I feel that I often play the moody villain. 

I hope that Camille gets good sound effects. They'll make the play a lot better.

I want to get in rehearsals with Karen! I'm really excited to start fleshing out our lines and blocking. There are some nice moments (especially the final scene) and I want to work them out. 

# Notes

* Focus on tempo -> include both pauses AND speed ups 

* Don't "act." I'm really bad for overacting.
