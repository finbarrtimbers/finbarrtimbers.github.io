# Need help developing your MVP?

If you are in search of a ML Engineer with a proven track record creating
minimum viable products, you're in the right place. [Get in touch](mailto:finbarr@finbarr.ca)
and let's discuss your needs.

My work is currently:

1. Informing the Alberta Government's multi-billion dollar trade deals,
2. Shaping Toronto Fire Service's station deployment,
3. Helping the University of Alberta Hospital Foundation target major donors.

I have experience developing minimum viable products based on cutting-edge
machine learning work. If you are in search of someone to build your prototype
or help your team expand their skillset, we should [talk](mailto:finbarr@finbarr.ca).

Even if you're not currently looking to hire, I'd love to hear about your
project and provide (free) advice. I'm a huge nerd and love geeking out about
projects.

I am currently accepting new machine learning consulting projects.
