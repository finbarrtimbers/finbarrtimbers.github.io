Employment:

I have been employed by the following entities since 2010:

- Darkhorse Analytics, Inc.,
- the Wildrose Party Caucus through the Legislative Assembly Office,
- the University of Alberta.

At Darkhorse, all of our clients were apolitical entities, consisting of
government and private industry.

Financial support:

For calendar years 2010-2016 (to date), the only entity that has financially
supported my research (other than the University of Alberta) is
[NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp).

Consulting activity:

From 2014-2016, I have worked as a consultant for the Wildrose Party Caucus.

Student clubs with which I am associated have received significant support from
both government and industry, including the Conservative Party of Canada, the
Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, the Wildrose Party, and various
companies in the oil and gas sector, and financial services.

Family conflicts of interest

To the best of my knowledge, no members of my immediate family have personal or
financial relationships which would be viewed by a reasonable individual to
constitute a conflict of interest with either my research or public commentary.

My fiancee works for Alberta Health Services, my father consults with the City
of Edmonton and various oil and gas companies, and my mother worked as a teacher
with various Catholic school boards. She currently is paid by the University of
Alberta.

Asset disclosure

I do not hold any individual shares. All of my assets are in broad, diversified
index funds offered by Vanguard.

Political Activity

I am not now a member of a provincial or federal political party.
In the past, I was a member of the PC party of Alberta, and a member of the
federal Conservative Party. I volunteered for
[Linda Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Duncan)'s 2011 election
campaign and have volunteered for various federal Conservative candidates.

I have acted as a consultant for the Wildrose Caucus since 2014, receiving
approximately \$10 000 annually in work from them.

I have made no political donations that I can recall (Iâ€™ll hedge in case I
attended an event which served as a political fundraiser at some point during my
university career). My spouse is not a member of any federal or provincial
political party.
