I recently finished a job hunt. I ended up with a job at DeepMind as a Research
Engineer, which so far has been an absolutely amazing experience. THis article
describes my personal thoughts on the job hunt, and has no relation to what
people at DeepMind think about the job market.

I think working at one of the big tech companies is the best way to start your
career as you can a) get a great name on your CV which will make it easier to
get subsequent jobs and b) make really good money, which if you save it, will
allow you to do riskier things later in your career. If you own a house/condo
it's a lot easier to take a low salary as you don't need to pay rent.

This isn't the case for everyone. If you love risk, working at a startup can be
a great experience, and if you choose the right one, it can give you an amazing
start to your career. However, this is extremely difficult, and you can often
fail. I'll expand on this more in a future post.

## Choosing a role

When it comes to finding a job, the first thing to do is to select the type of
role you want. Then, focus on applying for those roles. That'll let you practice
for the same type of questions and get good over time. Many companies use the
same questions, so interviewing for the same type of position at different
companies is excellent practice. For instance, most of my interviews involved me
writing a
[breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). BY
the end of the process, I was able to converge on what I think is a relatively
efficient
[implementation](https://gist.github.com/finbarrtimbers/afcbd0900a13a3af5e3ac0eabbe48511).

The various roles, as I think of them:

- Frontend Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- ML Engineer
- Full Stack Engineer
- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Data Analyst

I focused on ML Engineer and Backend Engineer roles. The specific names will
vary significantly by company. I was mostly interested in roles that were
engineering focused (so not data scientist/analyst roles), let me work on
consumer facing products, and let me do machine learning.

## Applying to companies

One thing to note: As a Canadian, if you have a technical degree (e.g. CS,
Math, Physics, etc.), you can get a TN-1 visa very easily and work in the US.
So I focused largely on applying to American companies, as they tend to have a
lot more financing, which makes the jobs more lucrative, and more interesting,
as they have more resources. This is an unfortunate reality. If you have an
advanced degree, you should also easily be able to get a green card through the
EB-2 process, although I am not a lawyer and didn't actually go through that
process.

I had three main sources of jobs:

1) [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) companies,
2) [Angel List](http://www.angel.co) companies,
3) An excellent [list](https://info.wealthfront.com/rs/781-RJU-318/images/Wealthfront_2016_Career_Launching_Companies_List.pdf
) published by Wealthfront, although it's slightly out of date.

Y Combinator (YC) is an American incubator, and arguably the best early stage
investment firm in the world. They take people with an idea and give them ~$120k
in exchange for 7% of the company. It's a great source of jobs at super early
stage startups (typically you'd be one of the first 5 employees), but is high
risk. YC is super dominant in Bay Area hiring. The people there can be more
willing to hire a junior person than bigger companies.

Angel List is a site that many early stage companies use to post jobs on.

This was my list of companies, in no specific order:

- Misc. YC companies
- PayPal
- eBay
- LinkedIn
- Modsy
- Curbsy
- Affirm, Inc
- Sift science
- Safegraph
- Foursquare
- Adyen (Adzen?)
- Flexport
- Pinterest
- PayPal
- Etsy
- Scale
- Cognii
- Gladly
- Squarespace
- Moderna
- Writelabs
- Mozilla
- Box
- Baidu
- AirBnB
- Niantic
- Twitter
- Optimizely
- SigOpt
- A9
- Dropbox
- VMWare
- Amazon
- Maluuba
- Element AI
- Snapchat
- Stripe
- Squarespace
- Slack
- Google
- DeepMind
- Apple
- Facebook
- Microsoft

Some of the companies will hire people remotely, although that can be tough to
do as a junior employee, and I wouldn't recommend it.

If you're focusing on Vancouver, Microsoft and Amazon are the only big tech
companies there hiring engineers (as far as I'm aware). Facebook is supposed
have an engineering office there, but I haven't seen any postings for it.
There's a bunch of smaller companies there too, such as Hootsuite.

## Getting the jobs

I'll post more on this subject in the future. TL;DR: study [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/).
