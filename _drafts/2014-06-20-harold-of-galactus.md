Easy Action used vivid physical choices to add realism to their improv. Mark had a mime background that he exploited to clearly define the set. I'm trying to get into their workshop on Tuesday on physicality.

*Lesson: make bold physical choices.*

Harold of Galactus (HoG) seized the audience's attention through incorporating the pitch into their show. After hearing the pitch, they started riffing on what exactly the pair planned to do with the prompt (in their case, the name of the superhero). 

Mark & Chris had great stage presence, constantly reaching out to the audience.

*Lesson: the audience is part of the show --- own that.*

The characters they created were distinct and easy to remember. The duo employed narration effectively, painting clear pictures of the stage.

A move that I don't use (but should) is miming undressing. Another is breaking the fourth wall. Chris is just witty as all fuck. That is something I want to emulate. The two kept making specific, hilarious, offers.
