title: Grad school vs. industry (a tech perspective)
tags: tech jobs

I've had a few friends ask me about which grad schools are the best to go to for
a career in tech, as I have a master's in econometrics from LSE, and work for
Google DeepMind (however, the thoughts below are entirely my own, and do not
reflect DeepMind's opinions at all). They're often surprised by my advice, which
is that grad school is, often, a bad idea. Let me explain.

Grad school comes in a few flavours:

1) What most people think of as grad school- a research focused master's,
sometimes followed by a PhD.
2) A course-based master's, rarely followed by a PhD.
3) A professional degree, like a MBA, law degree, or MD.

I have no opinion about 3), as I don't know anything about that route. I
followed route 2). Most of my coworkers followed route 1).

Route 1) is an excellent way to go if you want a career in research. In fact,
if you want a career in research, it is almost the only way to do so. If you
apply to do a research focused master's, it should come with scholarships that
pay for your tuition, and provide you with a stipend to live in.

Route 2) is what I did.
