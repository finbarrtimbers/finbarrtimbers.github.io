A cliche business quote is to hire based on someone's potential, not
the list of accomplishments they have. Like many cliches, it's
true. You should do this. If you have an applicant that you think
could accomplish great things given the chance, you should do
this. You're looking at a free lunch: you can tell people, wow, I'm such a great leader/mentor/manager, I enabled this schmuck to do great things.

An idea that's less common is to hire based on someone's rate of improvement. This is to say; if someone has not accomplished anything, but appears to have greatly increased their capabilities in the last year, you should prefer them over someone who has not improved.

Why? Because Any positive improvement int he rate of improvement will domiante over time.

An analogy can be made to developer tooling in tech companies. Most tech companies
radically under-invest in developer tooling. This is despite the fact that the math
is overwhelmingly in their favour: If you have 10k SWEs, and you can improve their productivity by 1%, this is equivalent to saving 100 SWE-years per year. Many companies have backlogs on their developer tooling teams that would enable them to save much more than 1% productivity.

Finally, there's an analogy to progress studies. If we believe that progress studies has any chance of working, we should be funding it massively. Yet, we don't. Why?
