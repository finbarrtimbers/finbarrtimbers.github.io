title: Follow-up on Brexit

I've had a few requests for more resources on Brexit, specifically, for
references in the academic literature that addresses the economic impact of
Britain leaving the EU.

Specific to Brexit, there's a bunch of great work done by the CEPR, which is
less technical but is a good overview for non-economists [5].

Slightly more technical articles by the CEP, which is LSE's policy branch:

 - "What would be the economic effects of the UK leaving the European Union on living standards of British people?" [1]
 - "The consequences of Brexit for UK trade and living standards" [2]
 - "Life after BREXIT: What are the UKâ€™s options outside the European Union?" [3]

 A lot of the underlying economic analysis is based on the trade literature, as
 Brexit can be modelled as the opposite of signing a free trade agreement. So
 there's work like [4] that estimates the impact of that, which can be reversed
 to estimate the impacts of Brexit.

If you represent a business/government that requires more extensive advice on
Brexit, or would like more detailed estimates on the economic impacts of Brexit
or similar economic events, please get in touch with me at
