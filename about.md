I'm currently in the final semester of a honours degree in mathematics
at the [University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca). I'm interested in functional programming, machine learning, and minimalist design.

I've worked on a couple of interesting projects:

   1. *Bug Deduplication:* I implemented a system that uses contextual data to predict whether or not two bug reports are duplicates. We created two main features:
      * A comparison of the stack traces between the two reports. 
      * A comparison between the text in each report and a number of different technical texts (e.g. cryptography textbooks, networking textbooks, etc.).

      We used the added features to train machine learning classifiers on the data through Weka. We got fairly good results: >95%. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/tannner/dedup), but it's not very well documented. We're currently cleaning it up, and we're going to be publishing it later this year. 
 
   2. *Mathematical Economics:* To come later. 

   2. *Law & Economics:* To come later.
