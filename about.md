I just finished a honours degree in mathematics
at the [University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca). A CV can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2v7fcspgj4qsbri/cv.pdf). I'm interested in functional programming, machine learning, and minimalist design.

# Research Projects

   1. *Bug Deduplication:* For CMPUT 466/551, I worked with a team to create a system that uses contextual data to predict whether or not two bug reports are duplicates. We used two main features:
      * A comparison of the stack traces between the two reports. 
      * A comparison between the text in each report and a number of different technical texts (e.g. cryptography textbooks, networking textbooks, etc.).

      The added features were used to train machine learning classifiers through Weka. We got fairly good results: >95%. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/tannner/dedup), but it's not very well documented. We're currently cleaning it up, and we're planning to publish in [ICSME](http://www.icsme.org/). 
 
   2. *Mathematical Economics:* I worked with [Dr. Christoph Frei](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~cfrei/) to study the convergence of the set of Perfect Public Equilibria for the Prisoner's Dilemma in Continuous Time. The work was an extension of [Sannikov's](https://www.princeton.edu/~sannikov/gamesRRR.pdf) paper on *Imperfectly Observable Actions in Continuous Time,* and showed that the set of PPE in discrete time converges to the continuous time set defined by Sannikov as the distance between repetitions goes to zero. I wrote a simulation in Matlab to show this graphically.  

   3. *Law & Economics:* I worked with [Dr. Claudia Landeo](http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/econweb/landeo/) to reconcile economic and legal theory. I explored judicial decision making in anti-trust law, and compared judicial rulings to economic theory; the goal of the project was to discover whether or not judicial decisions are economically valid; we discovered that they were (at least in our sub-area).
