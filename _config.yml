bio: |
    I'm Finbarr. I'm solving intelligence
    ([disclaimer](http://finbarr.ca/disclaimer)). Learning systems will
    transform society in the next decade, and I'm making that happen.

    What does that mean? Learning systems, such as [MuZero](https://paperswithcode.com/method/muzero), will replace manually designed systems, such as [coding](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode), [industrial controls](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40), and [video game AI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918300553).

    If that interests you, let's talk. I'm a senior AI/ML engineer at a large tech company. I will happily talk to you about your startup pitch, your fundraising deck, or how to get a job in tech. You cannot possibly waste my time.

    I am actively looking for startups to invest in ($25-50k checks). See my [requests for startups](/rfs) for more detail, but I'm open to pitches if they don't fit that mold.

    I read a lot, and discuss the books I've [read](/reading).

     I turned my academic research into a SaaS app that automatically analysed &
     deduplicate bug reports. Unfortunately, it was too expensive for me to
     keep running, but I have the code & can deploy it with a few hours work.

     If anyone's interested in using this at their company, I'd love to talk to
     you.
