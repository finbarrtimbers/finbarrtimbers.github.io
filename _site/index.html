    <p>I currently live in Alberta. I will be working at <a href="https://midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> come April. I used to work at <a href="www.deepmind.com">DeepMind</a>. I studied at the LSE and the University of Alberta. I have a <a href="https://finbarrtimbers.substack.com/">Substack</a> where I write about AI research.</p>

<!--I'm currently looking for a job, so please reach out if you are looking to hire a senior research engineer, preferably working on generative AI (of any kind: images, language, whatever). I'm currently only looking at remote opportunities, unfortunately.-->

<p>Areas of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generative AI</strong>. Computers are making it easier than ever before to make art (or write code, or write text, orâ€¦). I want to see how far this rabbit hole goes. I'm particularly excited by language models.</li>
  <li><strong>Large models</strong>. I'm <em>really</em> excited by the scaling results we've seen with Chinchilla and the GPT line of work. This is a priority for me and an area that I want to focus my professional work on.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>. Computers that can engage autonomously with the world. What's not to love?</li>
  <li><strong>Startups</strong>. I do a small amount of angel investing and advising of AI startups. If you're starting an interesting company, please reach out.</li>
</ul>
