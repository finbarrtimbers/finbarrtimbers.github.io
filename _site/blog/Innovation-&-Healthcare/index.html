    		<p>A pretty cool new <a href='https://eligibleapi.com'>API</a> was recently released. Eligible aims to make electronic patient records much easier to access; currently, the industry uses a hodge-podge of standards; Eligible parses them, and makes the data easy to use.</p><p>I hope that Eligible succeeds. I am not hopeful.</p><p>Innovation in healthcare is <em>hard</em>- there is always a very high potential of losing a huge lawsuit and being wiped out. In the Sunday Edition of the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com' title='The New York Times'>New York Times</a> (which can be delivered to Edmontonians!), an <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/business/overcoming-obstacles-to-better-health-care.html?_r=0' title='Overcoming obstacles to better health care'>article</a> laid out some of the main issues preventing said innovation from occuring.</p><p>The problem is simple: the legal framework surrounding malpractice is completely screwed up. In the article, it is stated that</p><p>&#8220;As it is now, a doctor or hospital can be sued if the plaintiff can show that “normal standards of care” were not followed, even if those normal standards of care are inappropriate.&#8221;</p><p>Assuming that this is correct (I am neither a physician nor a lawyer), this basically freezes innovation, and makes it nigh impossible for innovation to occur.</p><p>Compare this to, say, the regulatory framework for file-sharing <a href='http://www.dropbox.com' title='Dropbox'>systems</a> or <a href='http://www.teslamotors.com' title='Tesla'>automobiles</a>. Both have much lower regulatory hurdles, and have seen massive innovation. Although healthcare is incomparable to either, I believe that it is worth considering loosening the rules surrounding healthcare, and implementing some of the suggestions made in the article, particularly the &#8216;safe harbour&#8217; provision.</p>
