    <h1 class=title-large>Alberta after oil</h1>
    <div class=content>
        <p>The Albertan economy lives and dies on the price of oil. That's problematic. Oil revenues are highly volatile, and don't conform to forecasts, as Robin Campbell is currently finding out. Problematic as this is, it's a problem that's familiar to one despicable breed of person- economists. A central problem of public economics is dealing with cyclical trends. As recent budgetary issues have shown, Alberta desperately needs to enact acyclical measures to flatten out the boom/bust cycle. The best way to do this is to create alternate sources of revenue that aren't tied to the price of oil.</p>

<p>The best way to do so? Increase spending on post-secondary education. However, the government shouldn't do so blindly. Alberta does not need more humanities grads, or more fine arts grads, or even more economics grads (as handsome, intelligent, and well spoken as we are). Alberta needs more people educated in the trades, in the hard sciences, and in business.</p>

<p>Redford had the right idea [1] in 2013 when she <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/university-of-calgary-engineering-receives-1425-million-from-province/article14768330/">announced</a> that the government was funding an expansion of the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering at the cost of the rest of Albertan PSE. Much as the PSE lobbyists squawked, it was the right move, and one that current political parties should consider.</p>

<p>Danielle Smith called for "100 bloggers" to write about Wildrose policy. Well, as a self-appointed blogger: the Wildrose Party should enshrine in the party platform the importance of funding post secondary education at an extremely high level and firmly commit to keeping the funding stable. The funding should be tied to specific programs and faculties, and designed to make Alberta the world's engineering capital. Funding should go to the faculties of engineering, science, and business, creating named professorships and dedicated positions for students to gain research experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, the government should create incentives for the highly educated Albertan students to remain in the province by creating a tax credit to pay off student loans for every year that the newly graduated engineer/scientist works in Alberta. The government should also provide tax incentives for companies to conduct R &amp; D in Alberta.</p>

<p>If the government followed such a program, in 20 years Alberta's economy would be thriving on the backs of brilliant engineers and scientists. With Alberta as the beating heart of Canadian industrial innovation, the province would see massive spillover effects creating a reverse brain-drain into Alberta, ending our craven reliance on the price of oil.</p>

<p>[1] Painful as that phrase is to write.</p>
