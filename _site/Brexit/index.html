    <h1 class=title-large>How will Brexit affect Alberta & Canada?</h1>
    <div class=content>
        <p>On Thursday night, Britain voted to leave the EU. The vote was called Brexit.
In light of Brexit, Canadian &amp; Alberta business owners/executives are wondering
what effects Brexit will have on their businesses. In this article, I provide an
overview of what business people in Canada can expect to happen.</p>

<p>Brexit will have two direct effects for Canadians to worry about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As the referendum is a nonbinding vote and has no direct effect other than to
demonstrate the political will of the British people, the immediate effect
of the vote will be to create immense instability. Markets are spooked
as it is unclear what will happen to Britain during negotiations, as
European countries have expressed their interest in punishing Britain so as
to provide a disincentive to other countries that seek to leave the European
Union.</li>
  <li>Once Brexit occurs, Britain will almost certainly trade less with the EU,
and correspondingly, trade more with other countries, such as Canada, which
is currently Britain's 3rd largest non-EU trading partner. If the pound
continues to devalue, as is likely, then British exports should soar. 
Consequently, if there are Canadian companies looking to purchase goods &amp;
services from British companies, now is an excellent time to do so. British
executives will be looking to reassure their shareholders/employees that
their companies are well prepared to weather the upcoming negotiations, and
will welcome the opportunity to secure non-EU contracts.</li>
</ol>

<p>What should Canadian companies do?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remain calm. Britain will be okay, although it will likely struggle
internally (the continued decline of small towns in Britain is likely to
continue). Estimates of the impact on GDP range from <a href="http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/EA022.pdf">3.1%</a> to <a href="http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit02.pdf">9.5%</a>, which
although bad, are not catastrophic. Britain will still have one of the
world's ten largest economies.</li>
  <li>If acquisitions of British talent/property/assets have been planned, now is
an excellent time to continue. The current devaluation of the British pound
represents a buying opportunityâ€” up to a 10% discount over what assets
would have been priced at last week. The tech sector in London, called the
Silicon Roundabout, is reeling as many of the clients are from Europe. Smart
Canadian companies can exploit this to secure valuable talent. Google has
done this, with much of the team behind their recent Go playing AI coming
from DeepMind, a British AI startup.</li>
  <li>Seek to strengthen trade ties with Britain.  Companies will be struggling
with the uncertainty, and will welcome the opportunity to reassure their
shareholders and employees that everything is business as usual.</li>
</ol>

Brexit, or would like more detailed estimates on the economic impacts of Brexit
