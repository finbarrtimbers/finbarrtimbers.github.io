    <div class=content>
        <p>I just finished a honours degree in mathematics at the <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>, and just updated my<a href="/cv.pdf">cv</a>.</p>

<p>I have strange tastes. I dig improvisational comedy, computational finance, and minimalist design. </p>

<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>

<ol>
  <li><em>Bug Deduplication:</em> For CMPUT 466/551, I worked with a team to create a system that uses contextual data to predict whether or not two bug reports are duplicates. We used two main features:
    <ul>
      <li>We compared the stack traces between the two reports. Unfortunately, as only 1\% of the reports had stack traces, 0.01\% of the pairs had reports, so the stack trace comparison was useless as a feature. </li>
      <li>A comparison between the text in each report and a number of different technical texts (e.g. cryptography textbooks, networking textbooks, etc.). The textual comparisons proved to be incredibly powerful predictors, and gave very accurate results by themselves. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The added features were used to train machine learning classifiers through Weka. We got fairly good results: ~95%. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/tannner/dedup">Github</a>, but it's not very well documented. We wrote a paper on the project that has been submitted for publication in <a href="http://www.icsme.org/">ICSME</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Mathematical Economics:</em> I worked with <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~cfrei/">Dr. Christoph Frei</a> to study the convergence of the set of Perfect Public Equilibria for the Prisoner's Dilemma in Continuous Time. The work was an extension of <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~sannikov/gamesRRR.pdf">Sannikov's</a> paper on <em>Imperfectly Observable Actions in Continuous Time,</em> and showed that the set of PPE in discrete time converges to the continuous time set defined by Sannikov as the distance between repetitions goes to zero. I wrote a simulation in Matlab to show this graphically.  </p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Law &amp; Economics:</em> I worked with <a href="http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/econweb/landeo/">Dr. Claudia Landeo</a> to reconcile economic and legal theory. I explored judicial decision making in anti-trust law, and compared judicial rulings to economic theory; the goal of the project was to discover whether or not judicial decisions are economically valid; we discovered that they were (at least in our sub-area). </li>
