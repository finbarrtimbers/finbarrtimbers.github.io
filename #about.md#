I currently live in Alberta. I used to work at [DeepMind](www.deepmind.com). I previously studied at the LSE and the University of Alberta.

I am currently looking for a job, so please reach out if you are looking to hire a senior ML engineer. Preference for remote, but open to relocation. I am a Canadian/Irish citiz

Email: finbarrtimbers (at) gmail.

Things I'm involved with and areas of interest:

- **Reinforcement learning**. Computers that can engage autonomously with the world. What's not to love? 
- **Investing**. I'm looking to do more angel investing. If you're starting an interesting company, particularly in the RL space, please reach out.
