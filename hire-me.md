I'm a graduate student at [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx) on the MSc [Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/graduate/taughtProgrammes2015/MScEconometricsAndMathematicalEconomics.aspx) (the top economics master's program in the world).

I have worked with top professors in economics conducting research in law and economics, and have worked with the Official Opposition in Alberta doing policy and opposition research. 

I'm a strong Python programmer and am experienced at data mining and statistics/machine learning. 

Send me an email at [ft@finbarr.ca](mailto:ft@finbarr.ca) to talk about potential projects.
