I am a statistical consultant with several years of experience in statistics &
analytics. A mathematician by training, I am intimately familiar with
statistical modelling and possess advanced econometric abilities. I have
published multiple papers on machine learning and statistical analysis.

I have worked with a variety of companies and industries, including political
parties, oil/gas companies, and governments; I currently work for [Darkhorse
Analytics](dha.io).

Prior to Darkhorse, I worked for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a
research analyst, and as a research assistant in mathematical economics and
machine learning.

Send me an email at [finbarrtimbers@gmail.com](mailto:finbarrtimbers@gmail.com) to talk about potential projects.
