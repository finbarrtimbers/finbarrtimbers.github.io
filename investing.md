A hobby of mine is optimizing. For finance, I'm first building a portfolio of broad-based index funds (edit: although 2022 revealed them to be much less diversified than one would have hoped).

So, first, index funds. I make a point of filling up my tax-sheltered accounts (in Canaada: RRSPs + TFSAs, and soon, when my son is born, his RESP). I have a 100% equity portfolio (mostly VFV + HXQ).
This is risky, but fine, as I'm focused on the longterm: >10 years from now. 

Then, a small portion in risky assets where you have an advantage.

For me, that's early stage tech companies. I believe that, given my expertise in tech, I have
an advantage at picking out companies. So I'm investing a small portion of my portfolio in
early stage companies: roughly 5%.
