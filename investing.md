A hobby of mine is optimizing. For finance, I'm first building a portfolio of broad-based index funds (edit: although 2022 revealed them to be much less diversified than one would have hoped).

So, first, index funds, and then, put a small portion in risky assets where you have an advantage.

For me, that's early stage tech companies.
