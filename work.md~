Ideas that I've found helpful at work:

## How to think about career progression, as an engineer:
1. L3. All about coding.
2. L4. Coding, but you don't need to have your hand held.
3. L5. You can manage a small team (1-5 engineers).
4. L6. You can manage a large team (5-10 SWEs) or multiple small teams.
