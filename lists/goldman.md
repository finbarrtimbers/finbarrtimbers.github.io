Edited version of list on "how to be a man" by [@GSElevator](https://twitter.com/gselevator).

* Rebel from business casual. Burn your khakis and wear a suit or jeans.

* It’s okay to trade the possibility of your 80s and 90s for more guaranteed fun in your 20s and 30s.

* Never stay out after midnight three nights in a row … unless something really good comes up on the third night.

* Become your own curator of information.

* When the bartender asks, you should already know what you want to drink.

* People are tired of you being the funny, drunk guy.  

* When in doubt, always kiss the girl.

* Tip more than you should.

* You probably use your cell phone too often and at the wrong moments. 

* Exercise. 

* Eat brunch with friends at least every other weekend. Leave Rusty and Junior at home.

* Be a regular at more than one bar.  

* Act like you’ve been there before.  It doesn’t matter if it’s in the end zone at the Super Bowl or on a private plane.

* A glass of wine or two with lunch will not ruin your day. 

* There’s always another level. Just be content knowing that you are still better off than most who have ever lived.

* You can get away with a lot more if you're the one buying the drinks.

* Ask for a salad instead of fries. 

* Don’t split a check.

* Cobblers will save your shoes. So will shoe trees.

* When a bartender buys you a round, tip double.   

* Money is about facilitating spontaneity.

* Be spontaneous.

* Buy a tuxedo before you are thirty. Stay that size. 

* Your ties should be rolled and placed in a sectioned tie drawer.  

* Measure yourself only against your previous self.

* Take more pictures.  With a camera.

* When you admire the work of artists or writers, tell them.  And spend money to acquire their work.  

* Your clothes do not match. They go together.  

* Yes, of course you have to buy her dinner.  

* Staying angry is a waste of energy. Get even or get over it-- Revenge can be a good way of getting over anger.   

* Always bring a bottle of something to the party.  

* Drink outdoors.  And during the day.  And sometimes by yourself.

* The New Yorker is not high-brow. Neither is The Economist.  

* No-one cares if you are offended, so stop it.  

* Never take an ex back. She tried to do better and is settling with you.

* Eating out alone can be magnificent. Find a place where you can sit at the bar.

* Read more. It allows you to borrow someone else’s brain, and will make you more interesting at a dinner party – provided that you don’t initiate conversation with, “So, who are you reading …”

* Ignore the boos. They usually come from the cheap seats.

* Start a wine collection for your kids when they are born.  Add a few cases every year without telling them.  It’ll make a phenomenal gift in twenty years.

* Remember, “rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men.”
