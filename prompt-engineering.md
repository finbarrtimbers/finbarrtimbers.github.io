I collect weird examples of [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering):

- The [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) paper is full of examples, e.g.: ![A prompt engineering example from the CLIP paper. In it, the authors find that adding the prefix "A photo of a \{label\}" increases the accuracy of their classifier (a text transformer) by 1.3%.](static/images/prompt-eng-clip.png)
- [Adding "Let's think step by step" before each answer increases the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7%](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1529278580189908993)
- [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) made answers less harmful by asking the model to choose the least harmful answer
