I live in Alberta. I work at [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/). I used to work at [DeepMind](www.deepmind.com). I studied at the LSE and the University of Alberta. I have a [Substack](https://finbarrtimbers.substack.com/) where I write about AI research.

Email: finbarrtimbers (at) gmail.

Areas of interest:

- **Generative AI**. Computers are making it easier than ever before to make art (or write code, or write text, or...). I want to see how far this rabbit hole goes. I'm particularly excited by language models.
- **Large models**. I'm _really_ excited by the scaling results we've seen with Chinchilla and the GPT line of work. This is a priority for me and an area that I want to focus my professional work on.
- **Reinforcement learning**. Computers that engage autonomously with the world. What's not to love? 
- **Startups**. I do some angel investing and advising of AI startups. If you're starting an interesting company, please reach out.
