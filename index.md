I'm an ai researcher and investor.

I work at [Ai2](https://allenai.org/), on RL for LLMs. I used to work at [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/) and [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com). I [write about AI research](https://www.artfintel.com/).

Email: finbarrtimbers (at) gmail.

Areas of interest:

- **Generative AI**. Computers are making it easier than ever before to make art (or write code, or write text, or...).
- **Large models**. I'm excited by the scaling results we've seen with Chinchilla and the GPT literature. This is where I focus my professional work.
- **Reinforcement learning**. Computers that engage autonomously with the world. The future of technology.
