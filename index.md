I currently live in Alberta. I used to work at [DeepMind](www.deepmind.com). I studied at the LSE and the University of Alberta.

I'm currently looking for a job, so please reach out if you are looking to hire a senior research engineer, preferably working on generative AI (of any kind: images, language, whatever). Preference for remote, but open to relocation. I am a Canadian/Irish citizen, so can work anywhere in North America or Europe.

Email: finbarrtimbers (at) gmail.

Things I'm involved with and areas of interest:

- **Generative AI**. Computers are making it easier than ever before to make art (or write code, or write text, or...). I want to see how far this rabbit hole goes. I'm particularly excited by language models.
- **Large models**. I'm _really_ excited by the scaling results we've seen with Chinchilla and the GPT line of work. This is a priority for me and an area that I want to focus my professional work on.
- **Reinforcement learning**. Computers that can engage autonomously with the world. What's not to love? 
- **Investing**. I'm looking to do some angel investing. If you're starting an interesting company, particularly in the RL space, please reach out.
