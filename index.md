I just finished a honours degree in mathematics at the [University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca). I'm interested in functional programming, machine learning, and minimalist design. My [CV](/cv.pdf) has more information about me.


# Research

   1. Karan Aggarwal, Tanner Rutgers, Finbarr Timbers, Abram Hindle, Russ Greiner and Eleni Stroulia. "A Simpler Approach to Contextual Detection of Duplicate Bug Reports." Under consideration (ICSME 2014). ERA category. Victoria, BC. September 2014. <br>
   Abstract: \[[pdf](link)\] Code: \[[github](github.com/tannner/dedup)\]

   2. *Mathematical Economics:* I worked with [Dr. Christoph Frei](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~cfrei/) to study the convergence of the set of Perfect Public Equilibria for the Prisoner's Dilemma in Continuous Time. The work was an extension of [Sannikov's](https://www.princeton.edu/~sannikov/gamesRRR.pdf) paper on *Imperfectly Observable Actions in Continuous Time,* and showed that the set of PPE in discrete time converges to the continuous time set defined by Sannikov as the distance between repetitions goes to zero.

   3. *Law & Economics:* I worked with [Dr. Claudia Landeo](http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/econweb/landeo/) to reconcile economic and legal theory. The project was based on I explored judicial decision making in anti-trust law, and compared judicial rulings to economic theory; the goal of the project was to discover whether or not judicial decisions are economically valid; we discovered that they were (at least in our sub-area).
